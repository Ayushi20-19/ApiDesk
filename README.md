<br/>

There are many great Extensions. however, I didn't find one that really suited a develpoer's needs for API Testing and Error Searching. so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a extension for developers that'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on only something that deserves. A project that solves a problem and helps others.
* You shouldn't be search again and again for same type of errors by opening new tabs.
* Api Testing without writing any code at one place.

Of course, no extension will serve all demands since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more features in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have reviewed to expanding this Extension!
